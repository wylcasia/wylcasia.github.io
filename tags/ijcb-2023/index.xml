      <description>Our paper won IJCB 2023 Best Student Paper Award Title Sclera-TransFuse: Fusing Swin Transformer and CNN for Accurate Sclera Segmentation
Authors Li, Haiqing; Wang, caiyong; Zhao, Guangzhe; He, Zhaofeng; Wang, Yunlong; Sun, Zhenan
Abstract Sclera segmentation is a crucial step in sclera recognition, which has been greatly advanced by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, when dealing with non-ideal eye images, many existing CNN-based approaches are still prone to failure. One major reason is that due to the limited range of receptive fields, CNNs are difficult to effectively model global semantic relevance and thus robustly resist noise interference.</description>
